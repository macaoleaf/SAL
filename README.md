# SAL (Scripts At Leisure)
Here are some scripts I have written when I am free.
I love technology. It can help people in reality.
Many friends of mine are running startups. They have helped me a lot.
I love technology. Simple coding could still do big things.
And now, it is time for me to help them in return.
I love technology. Things I have done would be tiny to the society, but great to my friends.

Currently, I have a position at following startups:
Nanjing Xuduo Food & Beverage Management Co., Ltd. - Algorithm Engineer
Apex Education Inc. - IT Support Specialist

Hope their business goes well in the future!
